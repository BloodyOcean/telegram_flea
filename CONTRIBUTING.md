Contributing Guidelines by GPT
# How to Contribute 🛠️
## Step 1: Find an Issue
Browse the open issues in the main repository and pick one you want to work on.
Or create one if you have found a bug or have a feature request.
## Step 2: Fork the Project 🍴
Click the "Fork" button on the main page of the repository to make a copy in your own account.

## Step 3: Create a Branch 🌿
```bash
$ git checkout -b Branch_Name
```
## Step 4: Work on the Task 👨‍💻👩‍💻
Make the necessary changes in the code or documentation.

## Step 5: Commit ✅
Add your changes through Git and create a commit with a descriptive message.

```bash
$ git add .
```
Create a Commit
```bash
$ git commit -m 'Your descriptive message'
```
NOTE: Each pull request (PR) should contain only one commit. If you have multiple commits, they need to be squashed.

## Step 6: Work Remotely 🌍
When your work is ready and complies with project conventions, upload your changes to your fork:

```bash
# Push your work to your remote repository
$ git push -u origin Branch_Name
```
## Step 7: Create a Pull Request ➡️
Go to the page of your fork on GitHub and click "New Pull Request". Verify that the changes are displayed correctly, and then submit your pull request.
